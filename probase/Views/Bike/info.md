### Key Points and Possible Extensions

1. **Navigation & Layout**  
   - Using `NavigationStack` (available from iOS 16 onwards) for modern navigation.  
   - Hiding the default Navigation Bar in favor of a custom title and layout.

2. **Gradient Background**  
   - A linear gradient visually separates the content and creates a bright, modern look.

3. **Map Integration**  
   - An interactive `Map` with a coordinate region bound to a `@State` property, letting users see their current route or location.

4. **Stats Cards**  
   - Simple, reusable `StatCard` views to display important metrics: speed, distance, heart rate, elevation, etc.  
   - Uses `Color.white.opacity(0.1)` for a subtle, blurred “frosted” effect on top of the gradient.

5. **Charts (iOS 16+)**  
   - Swift Charts to show speed trends over time.  
   - Use additional mark types (`BarMark`, `PointMark`, `RuleMark`) for more advanced visualizations in iOS 18 or beyond.

6. **Controls**  
   - Action buttons for starting/pausing rides.  
   - Extend with additional toggles, timers, or advanced controls such as voice feedback or watch integration.

7. **iOS 18 Enhancements**  
   - Consider using **SwiftData** or **CoreData** for persisting ride history.  
   - Integrate with **HealthKit** and **WorkoutKit** for more precise fitness tracking.  
   - Explore new SwiftUI features like enhanced animations, interactive widgets, or new share features (if introduced in iOS 18).
